Hi. 

You can call me Fenyl ("Fen" like in Fence, "ull" like in null)
Fen also works. (Honestly I came up with this username at random).

I'm just a CompSci student at the moment.
Haven't done anything crazy or anything like that. 

I dunno is there like DMs in GitHub? If there is just contact me through there I guess.
Don't really want my email to get flooded.
